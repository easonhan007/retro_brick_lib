**About Me**

Hi, I'm the creator (and currently the only maintainer / porter / tester / complainer) of **Retro Brick Library** — aka “寨机风云录” in Chinese.

Slogan: **The Complete Archive for Retro Handhelds**

I've been into portable gaming since the GBA and NDSL days, and I've never really grown out of it. A few years ago I discovered the wild world of **retro handhelds** — those ultra-cheap, surprisingly capable little “brick” machines from China and beyond — and I fell deep.

Some people call them junk, some call them the ultimate budget kings.  
Some buy them for fun and abandon them in a drawer, while others squeeze full modern ports or heavy emulation out of 40-dollar plastic bricks.

I'm definitely in the second group. I enjoy testing them, pushing them to their limits, documenting what actually works (and what hilariously doesn't), and sharing the messy truth.

That's why I started this site — to build a relatively honest, no-BS archive of how these retro handhelds perform in real life: the good, the bad, the “how is this even running?” moments, and all the pitfalls to avoid.

If you're also obsessed with these quirky little bricks, feel free to hang out, discuss, argue, or even send your own test reports — the more chaotic voices, the better.

Welcome to **Retro Brick Library**. Enjoy your stay in the retro handheld jungle.
