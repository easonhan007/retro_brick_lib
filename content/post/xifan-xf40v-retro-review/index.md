Xifan Technology has launched its new handheld console XF40V after two months of development, showcasing creativity and practicality. Key specifications include a 4000mAh battery, a square IPS screen (720x720 resolution), and compatibility with various emulators and games. The package includes a storage case, soft protective film, data cable, and replaceable joysticks, featuring large-angle Hall joysticks that support downward pressing and can be swapped for longer or shorter options.

This console supports RGB ambient lighting, vibration feedback, and WiFi connection. The default system version is 1E4.7, offering stability and an overclocking option to enhance performance. It is compatible with multiple game emulators, such as NDS, GBA, PS1, and PSP, and performs seamlessly with most games when overclocked. The NDS emulator includes a cheat function for quick access to invincibility mode, with excellent visuals and point-to-point scaling for optimization.

The square screen design makes XF40V well-suited for native ratio games like GBC and PICO-8, with potential for future integration of Garva emulators. Overall, this handheld stands out with interchangeable joysticks, vibration functionality, and superior display quality. Its stable performance and strong compatibility make it a great choice for handheld gaming enthusiasts.
