This video reviews the now-discontinued MIO MINI, a classic handheld gaming console, and compares it to the MIO MINI PLUS. MIO MINI boasts a compact and sleek design, sharing the same button layout as its larger counterpart but with greater portability. The buttons are made of silicone with a balanced softness, and the back features comfortable micro-switch buttons. The top is equipped with a 3.5mm headphone jack, Type-C charging port, and TF card slot, while the replaceable 2000mAh battery adds practicality.

The device features a 2.8-inch screen with clear and vibrant visuals. It weighs only 109.5 grams, making it highly portable. MIO MINI supports a wide range of classic gaming platforms, including PS1, arcade, and TBA, offering smooth performance and a satisfying gaming experience. Although the small size may slightly impact grip comfort, this can be improved with a 3D-printed grip accessory.

Overall, MIO MINI is described as "small but mighty," combining attractive aesthetics with solid performance and is considered the peak of the MIO series in design. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued and is now only available through second-hand markets. The video ends by encouraging viewers to share their opinions on MIO MINI and MINI PLUS and to support the content creator.
