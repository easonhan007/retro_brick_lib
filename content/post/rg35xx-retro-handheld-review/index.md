This video introduces the RG35XX, a portable handheld gaming console priced at around 200 RMB. The unboxing reveals its features, such as silicone buttons, HDMI video output, dual TF card slots, a single speaker, and a non-removable battery compartment. Compared to the similarly priced Miyo Mini Plus, the RG35XX stands out with its video output capability but has a slightly grayer screen display and less ergonomic button design compared to Miyo Mini’s stepped back buttons.

The console supports various emulator platforms, including GBA, GBC, FC, GB, and more, with the addition of the PICO platform. The video demonstrates gameplay from the PICO game "Celeste," showcasing its background music and smooth controls. The system includes user-friendly shortcuts like brightness adjustment, fast-forwarding, saving, and more.

The video also provides detailed measurements (80.8mm width, 116.5mm length, 14.8-19.8mm thickness) and weight (179g) of the device, comparing it to the Miyo Mini Plus, which weighs 165.4g. While the RG35XX has a slightly wider screen bezel and less comfortable buttons, its compact design and video output feature make it a cost-effective choice. Viewers are encouraged to share their opinions in the comments and support the channel.
