The Miyoo A30 is a compact and retro-styled handheld gaming console with a focus on portability and functionality. Its eco-friendly packaging includes a USB-C charging cable and a C-to-3.5mm headphone adapter, as the device lacks a headphone jack. Featuring a 2.8-inch screen, a 2600mAh battery (supporting 5V/1.5A charging), and a lightweight build of 111.7g, the A30 is highly portable. Its metal-brushed front and plastic back form a three-piece design, offering a comfortable grip.

The button layout includes a D-pad, AXBY buttons, an analog stick, and LR/L2/R2 shoulder buttons, all providing responsive and comfortable feedback. Powered by a Linux system, the A30’s interface is simple and supports various emulators (e.g., PSP, IA, Pico-8, EasyRPG) alongside media playback and e-book reading. Tests reveal that the A30 runs PSP games like *Ridge Racer* and *JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure* smoothly, even in intensive scenes, with no noticeable frame drops. The audio quality is decent, though certain games may experience minor sound distortion due to default core settings.

However, the device has a minor flaw in its build quality, with slight lifting at the junction between the metal front panel and plastic back, possibly due to insufficient adhesive. Furthermore, the single speaker design limits audio performance. Overall, the Miyoo A30 is a cost-effective handheld console ideal for users seeking portability and retro gaming experiences.
