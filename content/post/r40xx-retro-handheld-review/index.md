The R40XX handheld console is a compact retro gaming device featuring a 4.2-inch screen with a resolution of 1024x768. It offers five color options and shares similarities with the R36H Pro Max in design. Equipped with a 3326 chip and 1GB of RAM, it supports PSP games, though performance is limited to certain 2D titles. With a 4000mAh battery, its capacity surpasses previous models (R46H’s 3000mAh and R36H Pro Max’s 3500mAh), ensuring longer playtime. The console’s build quality has improved over earlier versions, offering a more refined exterior.

The button design uses conductive rubber material, providing a balanced tactile feel. The rear shoulder buttons are touch switches, enhancing usability. The console features a TF card slot, speakers, DC OTG port, and a headphone jack on the top, supporting various connectivity options. It runs on the ARK OS 2.0 system and is compatible with memory cards from other devices. The screen delivers crisp visuals, ideal for retro games, with a 4:3 aspect ratio that enhances the viewing experience. PS1 games run smoothly at over 60 FPS, while high screen resolution limits PSP game performance.

The console includes WiFi functionality for streaming videos, offering basic yet practical features. Weighing 238 grams, it is lightweight and portable. The R40XX provides better overall performance than its predecessors, especially in terms of exterior quality and battery life. This vertical handheld console is an excellent choice for retro design enthusiasts and fans of nostalgic gaming experiences.
