This video introduces the high-end Android handheld gaming device "1号方堂," priced at 3998 CNY. The device features 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The unboxing reveals a quick start guide, a fast-charging adapter, and replaceable directional pads. The handheld boasts a dual-screen design: a 6.01-inch OLED main screen with DC dimming, 100% sRGB color gamut, and 450 nits brightness, and a 3.92-inch OLED secondary screen ideal for retro games like SFC, MD, and FC.

Powered by the Snapdragon G3-3 processor optimized for gaming, the device delivers excellent performance. It runs high-quality games like "Zenless Zone Zero" and "DNF" smoothly even at max settings. Its dual-screen design allows for various configurations, such as split-screen gameplay or switching between different screen sizes, offering versatile gaming experiences. The device also supports button mapping and gyroscope functionality for enhanced control.

Furthermore, the handheld excels in running high-resolution emulators, such as NDS, PSP, and PS2, achieving smooth gameplay at up to 8x resolution for titles like "God of War." Its unique four-mode transformation enhances flexibility, though the hinge durability is noted as a potential concern. However, with a 4-year warranty, this is less of a worry. Overall, the 1号方堂 stands out for its powerful performance, multifunctionality, and innovative design, making it a worthy collectible for gaming enthusiasts.
