In this video, the host of the Wandering Handheld Channel presents a detailed review of a new handheld console and offers it to fans in the comments section. The video begins by discussing the console's appearance and button design, noting that all buttons are made of conductive rubber, providing a moderate tactile feel. The device features an OTG port and headphone jack on top, a DC charging port, and a TF card slot at the bottom, with a single speaker located in the lower right corner.

This handheld uses a closed-source system supporting PS1 games with a resolution of 640x480, making it suitable for beginners with low technical requirements. The screen is IPS, with adjustable brightness, though its color performance is inferior to the R36S. The video showcases game performance, noting that PS1 game "Tekken 3" has unstable frame rates, while arcade games and GBA emulators run smoothly. The console also offers features like game history, favorites, and search, facilitating game management for users.

Overall, the device boasts a simplistic design and easy operation, catering to users who do not require high performance. Its low price makes it an excellent option for those unwilling to spend much time on settings. The device is well-constructed, with reasonable button design, ideal for a straightforward gaming experience.
