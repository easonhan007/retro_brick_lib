This video provides an in-depth review of a $30 Android square screen handheld console, discussing its value for money and usability. First, the design is rounded, with a 4-inch, 720x720 resolution touchscreen. The button layout places the D-pad at the bottom, which may cause input issues during use. The ABXY buttons feel responsive, but the joystick is not confirmed to be a hall joystick. The overall material is hard plastic, with slight ergonomic considerations.

In terms of functionality, the console runs on Android and supports basic emulators (NDS, DC, PSP, etc.) and touchscreen operations, making it suitable for certain games. However, its low configuration results in slow system loading times. Running apps like Bilibili and TikTok often leads to significant delays or freezes. While it supports TF card expansion, it lacks video output, which is a drawback compared to other retro handheld consoles.

Regarding internal build quality, the speaker is mono, and the cooling holes are purely decorative without any actual cooling function. Despite its low price, the wide screen bezel and average internal construction limit its overall performance. In summary, this handheld is suitable for budget-conscious users and retro console enthusiasts. The video concludes by suggesting that those seeking better performance in Android handhelds might want to look into Linux-based devices.
