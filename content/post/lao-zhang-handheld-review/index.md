This video reviews a handheld console codenamed “Pixie.” The device features a 2.4-inch screen with a resolution of 240×302 but lacks glass protection and shows noticeable color distortion when viewed from an angle. In terms of performance, the console smoothly runs various classic games, including arcade titles, PS1 games (e.g., "Ridge Racer"), indie games (e.g., "Chinese Paladin 98," "Jin Yong’s Martial Arts"), Flash games, and EZRPG. However, it supports up to PS1 games at best.

Despite decent gaming performance, the small screen size limits the device's usability. Additionally, it supports basic functions like e-book reading, music, and video playback, but the music player is cumbersome to use and lacks features like comic viewing. The overall design is appealing, featuring a metallic build, a Type-C port, a headphone jack, dual L2 buttons, and an aesthetic power indicator light.

In summary, priced at around 400 RMB, this handheld is suitable as a portable backup device. However, it may not satisfy users seeking a larger screen or more advanced functionalities.
