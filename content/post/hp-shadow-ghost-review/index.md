This video reviews HP's unreleased Omen handheld console. With a red-and-black color scheme, its size is comparable to the Steam Deck but slightly larger than the ROG Ally. The console features a 7.4-inch 1080P display, runs on Android 10, and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor. The design includes a soft-grip material for the controllers, large joysticks, micro-switch shoulder buttons, and four rear buttons. A magnetic connector in the center allows for docking or a built-in stand. However, the soft material of the grips may become sticky over time.

In terms of performance, the console supports cloud gaming and light AAA titles but struggles with performance due to throttled Snapdragon 865 capabilities. While running "God of War 2," it fails to maintain consistent frame rates, and key mappings for certain controller buttons are non-functional. The rear buttons also have limited utility. Weighing 671 grams, the console feels robust but heavy, making it suitable for extended gaming sessions.

The teardown reveals a modular internal design with a 29.33Wh battery, suggesting development around 2020. Dolby audio enhances sound quality, providing an enjoyable gaming experience. However, the lack of active cooling might explain the underwhelming performance. Despite some promising features, the console falls short in delivering optimal performance and compatibility, leaving it as an interesting but underwhelming prototype.
