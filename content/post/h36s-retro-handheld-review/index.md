The video reviewed the H36S handheld console, focusing on its unboxing and performance evaluation. This foreign-trade device is equipped with an A133P quad-core chip, 1GB RAM, a 3.5-inch 480P IPS screen, and supports PSP games with a theoretical battery life of 5 hours. The packaging includes an all-English manual, a data cable, and the console itself. Its ergonomic design features a grip and buttons such as a D-pad, ABXY conductive rubber buttons, dual joysticks, and micro-switch shoulder and trigger buttons, providing decent tactile feedback. However, flaws like mold burrs and a mono speaker were noted.

Upon booting, the console runs the Batocera B system. The IPS screen delivers solid performance with wide viewing angles. Multiple games were tested, including NDS, DC, arcade, Tekken 3, PSP God of War, and N64. NDS games were smooth but suffered from mono sound and poor audio quality; DC games experienced occasional frame drops; arcade games had noticeable button mapping issues; PSP games ran at 20-25fps, unable to reach 30fps; while N64 games ran relatively smoothly. Overall, the screen stands out, and game performance is decent, but the audio quality, button mapping issues, lack of WiFi, and vibration functions limit its appeal. Suitable for users tolerant of these shortcomings.
