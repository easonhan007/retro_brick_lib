The Mio Mini V4 gaming handheld has recently dropped in price to around 240-250 RMB, garnering attention from users. In the video, the creator shared an unboxing and hands-on review. The V4 maintains Mio Mini's compact design, being as small as a cigarette box and weighing only 109 grams, making it highly portable. Compared to V1-V3, the V4 features improved button layouts, including optimized D-pad and ABXY buttons. Its screen resolution of 720×560 delivers sharp and clear visuals.

In terms of gaming performance, the V4 supports various emulators and game formats. Arcade games run smoothly, DOS and GB games perform well with clear text, and GBA games operate stably. The Java emulator also works fine. However, certain platforms like NDS show compatibility issues, such as screen glitches. PS1 games, on the other hand, run fluidly with excellent graphics, benefiting from the high PPI and small screen size.

Currently, the handheld's software system is still being optimized. Game bundles from V1-V3 are not fully compatible with V4, requiring users to reorganize game resources. The creator plans to refine the system and share updated configuration files for easier use.

In conclusion, the Mio Mini V4 stands out with its portability and impressive display but still requires improvements in compatibility and system optimization.
