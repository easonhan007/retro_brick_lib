The G36 Ultra is a budget-friendly Android handheld console focusing on retro emulator gaming. It features an A7 quad-core chip with a 2.0GHz clock speed, a 480P screen resolution, 2.4G WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, and a 3000mAh battery. The device offers various color options, with conductive rubber ABXY buttons, a stiff D-pad, and clickable analog sticks. The back includes ergonomic grips, a TF card slot, and standard ports like a DC power input, OTG port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.

Running on Android, the G36 Ultra supports multiplayer online gaming and comes pre-installed with 10 games. However, the interface lacks Chinese language support, and the online matchmaking system currently seems underpopulated. In terms of performance, PS1 and GBA games run smoothly, but PSP titles like *God of War* face noticeable frame drops even with a 2.0GHz clock speed. The screen offers good full-viewing angles, although the device lacks support for DC, NDS, and N64 emulators. Certain buttons, such as the D-pad, are uniquely designed, providing a decent experience for games like *Contra*.

Overall, the G36 Ultra performs similarly to RK3326-based consoles and is suitable for budget-conscious gamers interested in retro gaming. The online multiplayer feature is a notable addition, though further system optimization is needed. Future updates may provide more detailed insights and improvements.
