Paoyi Tang has launched the V20, a budget-friendly handheld console priced at just 199 yuan. The V20 features several upgrades, including dual joysticks (with a pressable right joystick), a 4:3 screen ratio upgraded to a 640x480 resolution, and improved button layout with the return of volume adjustment keys. It comes with a 5000mAh battery offering up to 6 hours of official runtime. The device retains dual TF card slots, two Type-C ports (charging and OTG), a 5mm headphone jack, and a clean top design without video output.

Equipped with the A133P processor, the V20 offers better performance compared to the previous 3326 chip. It supports various ported games and mainstream emulators, such as the God of War series, Dynasty Warriors, fighting games, and NDS emulators. However, under heavy load scenarios, the frame rate may drop below 20 FPS, making it less ideal for demanding games. The screen, despite not supporting point-to-point display, provides decent visuals with adjustable filters and masks. The controls are generally good, with firm buttons and precise joystick and D-pad responsiveness.

The handheld runs on a custom Nex system, supporting shortcut functions like screenshots, frame rate display, and screen brightness adjustments. While some functional keys remain undefined, the overall system is well-optimized. With its competitive pricing and decent gaming capabilities, the V20 caters to retro gaming enthusiasts looking for an entry-level handheld device.
