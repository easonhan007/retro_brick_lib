This video reviews the “Time Armor R3,” a handheld console priced around 200 RMB, currently in its prototype phase. It features a 4-inch, 720x720 non-touch display and runs on Android 5.1. The design places the D-pad below and the joystick above, with buttons that feel stiff due to the lack of silicone padding, potentially impacting comfort. Weighing 220 grams, the device includes dual speakers, a 5000mAh battery, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a DC charging port but lacks video output support. The processor is a [MediaTek MT6592V](https://www.mediatek.com/press-room/mediatek-launches-mt6592-true-octa-core-mobile-platform), offering weaker performance compared to the [3566](https://www.rock-chips.com/a/cn/product/RK35xilie/2021/0113/1273.html) platform.

System-wise, its Android interface is limited, as users cannot navigate back to the Android home screen. For gaming, it performs well with PSP 2D games but struggles with 3D titles. PS1 games support a 4:3 aspect ratio, but filter and overlay settings are non-adjustable. Retro games like GBC titles run smoothly but suffer from slow loading speeds and lack fast-forward or quick-save features. Overall, system optimization is needed.

Despite its low price, the “Time Armor R3” has shortcomings in ergonomics, system functionality, and optimization. Future retail versions may see improvements. The video also mentions a giveaway for this console, encouraging viewers to follow for updates. In summary, this console is suited for budget-conscious users seeking a simple retro gaming experience.
