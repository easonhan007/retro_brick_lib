This review focuses on the K59 handheld gaming console, with packaging still from the older K56 model. The design is similar to its predecessor, and notable upgrades include improved chip performance and a cooling fan (available in select versions). The device features a 5.67-inch full-view IPS screen with a resolution of 1920×1080p, adjustable color temperature, eye-care mode, and a pixel density of 389ppi. Display quality is good, with no issues like backlight bleeding or dead pixels. Hardware specs include the MT6789 chip (G99), G57 dual-core GPU, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage (UFS type), CPU clock speed of 2.2GHz, and a refresh rate of 60Hz.

The system runs on Android 14 and comes pre-installed with various emulators, supporting gaming platforms like PSP, PS1, and PS2. Performance tests show an AnTuTu benchmark score of 560,000. Many games run smoothly at high resolutions, such as PSP's "God of War" at 3x resolution and PS1 games at 3x resolution. While some emulators exhibit issues like background noise, official emulators provide better optimization. The cooling fan offers three modes to cater to different performance needs.

Overall, the K59 is an upgraded version of the K56, offering improved performance and compatibility with Android games and select PS2/3DS titles. Positioned as a mid-range option, it delivers excellent value for its price and stands out in its category compared to similarly priced alternatives.
