Today, Langzi Playing Digital unboxes and reviews the handheld A133P, model mini zero28. The device features an A133P chip with 2G DDR4 memory and a 2.8-inch IPS display with a resolution of 640x480, supporting WiFi connectivity. It is compact in size, with a 2900mAh battery offering a battery life of approximately 7-10 hours. The handheld's design is straightforward, with conductive rubber keys and soft-feeling joystick and shoulder buttons providing a comfortable grip. The system runs on Android, requiring an external mouse for setup as the screen lacks touch capability. Pre-installed apps include a calendar, clock, music, and video player. WiFi only supports 2.4G. The device supports multiple emulators like PS1, PSP, and DC, with stable frame rates, especially DC games achieving 30 fps. The full-view IPS screen delivers color-consistent visuals from various angles. N64 and arcade games also perform well, while NDS games are visually decent despite the small screen. Though the A133P chip's performance lags behind the 3566, its Android system efficiency and emulator effectiveness are commendable. Priced around 300 yuan, it's suitable for users seeking portable handheld devices.
