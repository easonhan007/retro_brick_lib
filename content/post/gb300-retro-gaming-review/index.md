This video focuses on the unboxing and review of the GB300, a retro game console priced at 54 RMB. The device supports multiple classic game formats, including FC, PCE, SFC, GB, GBC, and GBA. It features TV output, a Type-C port, and a replaceable 18650 battery. The package includes a charging cable and TV connection cable, with the speaker located on the back of the console.

In terms of performance, the GB300's screen quality is subpar, with noticeable color distortion and non-IPS technology, resulting in mediocre display performance. Game performance varies: FC and MD games run smoothly, while SFC and GBA games show significant lag, frame drops, and audio distortion. GBA games, in particular, suffer from slow-motion issues. The device also lacks screen ratio adjustment, causing stretched and distorted visuals.

Although the GB300 offers features like multi-language support, a favorites list, and history tracking, its functionality remains basic. The device supports up to GBA-level games, but many formats exhibit poor performance. Overall, the GB300 is a low-cost retro console suitable for casual nostalgia but is limited to running low-performance games. The video concludes by emphasizing the affordability of the device and invites viewers to follow the channel for more content about similar budget gaming products.
