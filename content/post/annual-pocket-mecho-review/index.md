The video focuses on the features and improvements of the Annual Pocket Mecho Classic handheld gaming device. Compared to the original version, this model removes the dual joysticks and adjusts the shoulder button positions. It retains the MediaTek G99 processor and a 3:2 aspect ratio screen with 4x resolution, maintaining its high-quality build. The device features a CNC-milled unibody exterior with a soft-touch back material, offering a sleek and premium feel. The D-pad and ABXY buttons use conductive rubber for moderate tactile feedback, while the shoulder buttons employ micro-switches with increased travel distance for a softer, more comfortable press.

The updated button mapping allows the D-pad to function as a joystick, supporting smooth gameplay for PS2 and GBA titles. The absence of joysticks enhances operational comfort and eliminates interference with hand placement, improving portability. The top of the device integrates a power button and fingerprint scanner combo for added convenience.

The package includes accessories such as a USB-C charging cable, stickers, tempered glass, and a carrying case. The redesigned case is better suited for the joystick-less model, ensuring no risk of joystick damage. The video recommends users choose between the joystick or joystick-less versions based on personal preference and warns that the black back cover may show sweat stains.

In conclusion, the Annual Pocket Mecho Classic is ideal for users who prioritize minimalist design and portability, especially for games like GBA that don’t rely heavily on joysticks.
