The Trimmy Smart Pro S handheld maintains a similar design to its predecessor but introduces more color options and refined details. It features a 1280x720, 5-inch fully laminated screen running on the Linux OS, without touch support. Performance upgrades include a processor jump from A133P to A523, offering smoother gameplay.

The hardware sees significant improvements, including active cooling with intake and exhaust vents for better heat dissipation. Button feedback is enhanced, with added L3 and R3 press functionalities. The triggers are larger, and the joystick height is raised with a TMHR module for better comfort. A new top shortcut button allows quick adjustments to brightness and volume. Despite the slight weight increase to 257g, portability remains relatively unaffected.

Gaming performance is stable across classic and ported games. For example, "God of War" maintains around 30fps at 2x resolution, with active cooling helping stabilize performance. Multimedia capabilities include video playback and streaming, though high-load scenarios may strain the system.

Internally, the Smart Pro S features improved thermal and antenna layouts, paired with a 5000mAh battery. The overall internal build shows upgrades but lacks perfection. The new color options provide variety, while the classic gray-white remains a favorite. With enhancements in performance, design, and ergonomics, the Smart Pro S stands out as a solid entry-level Linux handheld console, especially if priced competitively.
