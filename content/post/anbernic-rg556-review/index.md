Anbernic has launched its new open-source handheld console RG556, maintaining its consistent design style. The transparent casing is visually appealing, featuring silicone buttons, pressable joysticks, and linear triggers for better control. The top section includes a power button, volume controls, and an active cooling fan, while the bottom offers a full-featured Type-C port and TF card slot supporting up to 2TB expansion. The ergonomic design of the back ensures comfortable grip, while the 5500mAh battery provides extended usage.

In terms of hardware, the RG556 sports a 1080P OLED screen (5.48 inches) and is powered by the Tiger T820 processor, comparable to Snapdragon 765G. It supports running some Switch games and performs smoothly with PS2 titles. Storage is 8+128GB and expandable. Emulator tests demonstrated stable performance in PS2 games like "God of War 2" with 60FPS at 1.25x resolution, while "Valkyrie Profile 2" showed slight lag in the town scenes. Android titles like "Genshin Impact" ran smoothly using button mapping. NS emulator handled 2D games well, though 3D titles were less impressive. Additionally, it supports streaming from PS5 and Xbox, offering a decent gaming experience.

On the downside, the durability of the transparent casing remains uncertain, and the vibration motor feels weak. Suggested improvements include adding lighting effects on the grip area for enhanced aesthetics. The teardown was incomplete due to tool limitations, but the transparent shell reveals neatly arranged internal components. Overall, RG556 delivers solid performance, suitable for retro emulation and streaming enthusiasts.
