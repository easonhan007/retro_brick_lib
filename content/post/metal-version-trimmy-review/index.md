The video presents the latest metal version of Trimmy's handheld console, Trimmy Break. The metal version retains the compact design of the original but features a CNC unibody metal casing, enhancing overall texture. Three color options are displayed: green, pink, and silver, inviting viewers to select their favorite. Compared to the plastic version, the metal version offers a superior feel, with improved back design featuring anti-slip and branding enhancements. Key functions remain unchanged, including customizable FN key and buttons, with replaceable plastic button material. The metal version weighs 205 grams, slightly heavier than the plastic counterpart. Its casing showcases ultra-fine matte metallic finish, primarily made from anodized aluminum. The console supports various emulators, accommodating different game types, and offers network, vibration, and Bluetooth functions. The media player performs well with good screen quality, supporting full-screen Bilibili comments. The video concludes by mentioning a giveaway of the console to viewers.
