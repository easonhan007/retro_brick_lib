This video introduces two budget-friendly handheld gaming consoles with power bank functionality, produced by Fenghuo Xiaozi. Priced at only 145 RMB for two units (around 70 RMB each), these devices are affordable. The packaging includes a manual, lanyard, data cable, TV output adapter, and joystick caps. The console features ABXY and LR buttons on the front, AV output, a Micro USB charging port, a TF card slot, and a volume dial at the top. The screen uses a non-full-lamination design, offering an IPS panel with wide viewing angles but noticeable color shifts.

The video demonstrates gameplay on several classic titles. Games like "Miracle 3-in-1" and "Metal Slug 3" experience lag, while older platform games (FC, SFC, GBA) generally run smoothly. The system supports approximately 5,000 pre-installed games and features search and history functions. However, the inability to adjust screen brightness is a drawback. The power bank functionality was successfully tested, allowing it to charge other devices such as the A30 handheld console, though it only supports slow charging.

In conclusion, this dual-purpose device combines retro gaming with charging capabilities. It is ideal for gamers on a budget or retro enthusiasts. While performance has limitations, the low price and decent features make it a cost-effective option with moderate usability.
