The newly released Ambonick RG477V is a vertical handheld console featuring a 4.7-inch 120Hz high-refresh LTPS screen with a resolution of 1280x960. Powered by the Dimensity 8300 processor, it comes in two configurations: 8GB+128GB and 12GB+256GB. Its design includes a full-glass front, Hall joysticks, and non-linear micro-switch trigger buttons, with the button layout switchable between Nintendo and Xbox styles. While the screen edges are slightly rounded, they can still feel a bit sharp to the touch.

In terms of performance, the RG477V handles demanding emulators such as PS3, PS2, and 3DS smoothly and supports high-resolution settings (e.g., 6x or even 8x resolution) for classic games. It also performs well in Android games (e.g., Genshin Impact) and PC game streaming, with stable frame rates and built-in controller mapping. Its cooling system features a single heat pipe turbo fan and heat spreader, ensuring effective heat management, with the main heat concentrated below the screen.

On the positive side, the RG477V boasts strong performance, supports higher resolutions for retro 4:3 games, and runs high-end emulators effectively. Downsides include the use of standard vibration motors, slightly sharp edges, and reduced portability due to its larger size compared to previous models. Overall, the RG477V is a powerful choice for retro and high-performance emulation gaming enthusiasts.
