This video reviews the entry-level handheld gaming console R36H Pro Max. Featuring a 3326 chip, the console supports games up to PSP, with a 4.2-inch fully laminated IPS screen offering a resolution of 1024x768. The display is bright and clear, running on the Linux-based ARKOS system and supporting 2.4G WiFi for third-party video apps.

Compared to the previous generation R46H, the R36H Pro Max offers several upgrades, such as softer button feedback, redesigned trigger-style shoulder buttons, and larger battery capacity with anti-slip grips. The device also includes two TF card slots, DC port, OTG port, headphone jack, and top-mounted ventilation holes, making it versatile in terms of functionality.

In terms of performance, the R36H Pro Max is ideal for retro gaming, particularly for PS1 and earlier titles, as well as certain ported games. Tests demonstrated smooth gameplay for PS1 titles like Tekken 3, while NDS and N64 performed well at default settings. However, it struggled with DC and PSP games due to hardware limitations. Its 4:3 screen ratio is better suited for PS1 gaming.

Overall, the R36H Pro Max is a budget-friendly handheld console with notable improvements over the R46H, including enhanced button feel, better battery life, and refined design. It is a great choice for retro gaming enthusiasts focusing on PS1 and earlier titles.
