This video provides an in-depth review of the upcoming V10 handheld console from ShuBan, highlighting its features and performance. The V10 features a 3:2 aspect ratio 3.5-inch screen, ideal for GBA gaming. Its design pays homage to the classic Game Boy, with a speaker on the lower right and dual Type-C ports (charging and OTG) on the top. The bottom includes a 3.5mm headphone jack and a TF card slot, while the back houses four rounded shoulder buttons and a 3000mAh battery.

Running on a Linux system, the V10 supports emulators for FC, NDS, and PS1, along with ported games like *Celeste* and *Shovel Knight*. The screen delivers good display quality and supports point-to-point scaling, optimized for GBA gameplay. Button responsiveness is satisfactory, with a smooth and improved D-pad design compared to the previous RGB10 model.

During gameplay demonstrations, the V10 showcased stable performance without lag or screen tearing, running 2D and fighting games smoothly. NDS games can be displayed in horizontal or split-screen modes. Weighing 164.2g, it is lightweight and portable. Although powered by a 3326 processor, its price of 199 RMB makes it highly cost-effective, especially for GBA enthusiasts.

In conclusion, the V10's screen, buttons, and improved aesthetics are its standout points, while its affordable pricing adds to its appeal. The video recommends the V10 for budget-conscious buyers and encourages viewers to engage in the comments section.
