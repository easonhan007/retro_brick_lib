The video provides an in-depth review and unboxing of the RGB10 MAX 3 handheld console. The device features a blue translucent matte finish, a 5-inch 720P full lamination screen, and an ergonomic grip design, offering good overall handling. Hardware-wise, it is powered by an RK3566 processor, 1GB RAM, and runs on a Linux system, supporting retro games. The handheld includes HDMI output, Bluetooth, WiFi (2.4G), and a 4000mAh battery.

During game testing, the console demonstrated stable performance on PSP games like *Tekken 5*, maintaining 60 FPS. However, it struggled with *God of War*, showing lag issues. It performed well with PS1, NDS, N64, and ported games, offering stable visuals and good sound quality. The directional pad had minor issues with rough edges causing discomfort, which needs improvement.

The RGB10 MAX 3’s screen quality stands out as a major highlight, making it ideal for lightweight retro gaming. However, its WiFi capabilities are limited, hindering high-performance streaming. The console is lightweight, portable, and sized comparably to other handhelds. A teardown revealed its internal structure, with the RK3566 processor at the center, and customizable joysticks and trigger buttons.

Overall, the RGB10 MAX 3 is a budget-friendly handheld console suitable for retro game enthusiasts but requires refinements in certain design aspects and performance areas.
