The video features a detailed unboxing and review of the G28 handheld gaming device. The G28 comes with a 4.3-inch IPS screen (480x272 resolution), a 2100mAh battery, and a 64GB memory card. Its design includes conductive rubber ABXY buttons, micro switch dual joysticks (supporting press functionality), HDMI output, TF card slot, Type-C charging port, and a headphone jack. The screen is a full-view IPS display with sharp visuals and vibrant colors.

Performance tests reveal that the G28 runs GBA games smoothly, with options to adjust screen proportions and resolution. For Dreamcast (DC) and Nintendo 64 (N64) games, the default 240p resolution allows partial playability, but frame rates hover around 20fps, showing average performance. PSP games at 1x resolution are playable in most scenarios. Other emulators, such as PS1 and below, run smoothly, while DC and N64 performance remains lackluster.

In summary, the G28 is a moderately performing handheld device with slightly weaker capabilities compared to devices using the 3326 chip. It is best suited for budget-conscious users who prefer larger screens. If priced appropriately, it could be a good entry-level handheld gaming option.
