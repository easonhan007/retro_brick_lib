This video features the unboxing and review of a handheld console equipped with the 3326 chip. Key specifications include: 1GB RAM, 3.5-inch 480P screen, WiFi connectivity, dual TF card slots, 3000mAh battery (officially stated to last around 5 hours), and support for multiple emulators (up to PSP). The device boasts a semi-transparent pink shell design, buttons with a stiff feel, dual speakers, OTG support, and an IPS full-view screen.

The handheld runs the official ARKOS system but also supports modding and alternative systems, including R36SP4. While its design and system are praised, the WiFi chip performs poorly, with slow network load times. Accessories include a protective film, a data cable that doubles as a strap, and a user manual.

Performance tests show stable 60 FPS for GBA games, smooth operation of NDS games with HD settings, and flawless playability of PS1 games such as Tekken 3. However, demanding PSP and N64 games experience noticeable frame drops, impacting gameplay quality. Overall, the console combines stylish looks and versatile functionality. Though its price may be on the higher side, it is suitable for gamers seeking reliable handheld performance.
