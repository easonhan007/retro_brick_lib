This video showcases the unboxing and testing of three Miyoo handheld consoles, all in the "Black Transparent" version. Each console features a 3.5-inch 480P resolution screen, 3000mAh battery, DC charging port, headphone jack, and dual S keys, with a well-optimized design and comfortable controls. Particularly, the shoulder buttons and D-pad are notably improved. The console also supports WiFi connectivity, system upgrades, and offers multiple theme options.

During the performance test, the video creator explored various retro games via built-in emulators, including arcade, FC, MD, NDS, PS1, and SFC. The games ran smoothly with excellent vibration feedback, especially for PS1 and SFC games. The D-pad was responsive and comfortable. Additionally, the device provides e-book and music functions, though the creator found them less practical due to fast battery drain during standby.

All three consoles performed reliably in testing, with functional screens and slight differences in button hardness across devices. The creator recommended the Miyoo handheld for beginners due to its ease of use and compatibility with various classic games. Despite being copied in design, its system optimization remains a standout feature.

The video concludes with a teaser for the next episode featuring unboxing of foreign handheld consoles, wrapping up the current content.
