This video reviews the RG Nano, an ultra-compact handheld gaming console small enough to serve as a keychain. The unboxing revealed its contents, including a user manual, certification card, charging cable, keychain attachment, and a protective mini leather pouch. The device features an aluminum alloy body, a clear display, a d-pad, AXBY buttons, and functional keys, with a Type-C charging port and micro switches on top. The back showcases the brand logo and a 1050mAh battery.

The RG Nano supports multiple retro game emulators, such as GBA, GBC, GB, GG, NGP, PS1, and NES. With similar specs to the Miyoo Mini, it performs impressively despite its size. The reviewer demonstrated games like PS1's "Resident Evil" and GBA's "Celeste," highlighting smooth gameplay and robust performance. Weighing only 73.5 grams, the device is lightweight, and the included leather pouch ensures portability and protection.

The RG Nano also doubles as a clock, enhancing its utility. Its compact, stylish design and versatile functions make it an appealing gadget. Shortcut keys allow adjustments like brightness control, adding to its convenience. The reviewer praised it as not only a portable gaming device but also a fun "idle-time gadget," dubbing it the ultimate keychain console.
