Anbernic has launched the upgraded version of its 35XX handheld console, named 35XX Plus, featuring several design and performance improvements. In terms of appearance, the 35XX Plus retains the look of the 35XX but introduces ergonomic design changes on the back. Button material and layout have been optimized for a more comfortable grip and smoother gaming experience. Adjustments to details like volume buttons and the HDMI port also enhance the overall build quality.

On the hardware side, the 35XX Plus upgrades the battery capacity from 2600mAh to 3300mAh with a replaceable design and adds WiFi and Bluetooth support. The processor has also been enhanced, enabling smoother performance for more emulators, including PSP and NDS games. The weight increased slightly from 178.6g to 193.2g, but the overall handling remains comfortable.

The 35XX Plus features a 3.5-inch 640x480 full-laminated screen with excellent display quality, wide viewing angles, and well-controlled backlight uniformity. It also supports point-to-point adjustments for game resolution. Gaming performance has been improved, with responsive and precise controls that are particularly suited for action games.

In conclusion, the 35XX Plus offers significant enhancements in battery life, performance, and functionality compared to the 35XX, making it an excellent choice for players seeking a more versatile and portable gaming experience.
