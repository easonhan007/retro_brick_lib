Anbernic has introduced a dual-screen handheld console, drawing heavy design inspiration from the classic NDS series. It is optimized for NDS and lightweight console game emulation. The device features dual IPS screens with consistent brightness, offering double the resolution of the original NDS. It supports touch functionality with a capacitive screen and 5-point touch, though the lack of an integrated stylus is a downside. The device is compactly designed, with a sturdy 180-degree hinge that allows for smooth adjustments.

In terms of hardware, the RK3568 processor scores around 150,000 on performance benchmarks, making it suitable for NDS and some lightweight 3DS games, though it struggles with more demanding 3DS titles. The dual-speaker setup mirrors the NDS style, delivering decent sound quality. The Android-based system supports multitasking with independent apps running on the dual screens. It also includes focus-switching functionality and an AI translation feature for ease of use when referencing guides or supporting gameplay.

Thermal performance is satisfactory, with heat concentrated around the screen and battery area, maintaining comfortable temperatures. The device's overall dimensions are similar to the NDSi LL, with improved joystick and button placements. Internal teardown reveals a tightly packed design, though room for DIY cooling modifications exists.

In summary, this retro-styled handheld is a good fit for NDS enthusiasts, though it falls short for users seeking high-performance 3DS gaming.
