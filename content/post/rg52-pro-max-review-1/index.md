The RG52 Pro Max is an upgraded version of the RG52 Mini. It features a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 resolution IPS display with full viewing angles. The design retains its mech-style aesthetics and comes in three color options: white, gray, and green. Weighing 357g, the console runs on Android 13 with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. The button layout is similar to the previous generation, with new additions like a built-in fan and joystick ambient lighting, both adjustable via the status bar.

In terms of performance, the console excels in gameplay. Tested games like PSP's *God of War*, PSV's *One Piece Pirate Warriors 3*, and the mobile game *DNF* ran smoothly with stable frame rates at medium to high settings. Emulator games (e.g., 3DS, NGC, PS2) performed well with proper resolution settings, achieving full-frame output. The battery capacity remains at 5000mAh, offering similar endurance as its predecessor.

Overall, with upgrades to the display, performance, and cooling system, the RG52 Pro Max stands out as a competitive option among similarly priced devices. It is a suitable choice for users who appreciate high-resolution screens and futuristic designs.
