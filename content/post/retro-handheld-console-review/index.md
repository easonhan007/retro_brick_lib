The video introduces the Helically handheld gaming device prototype, highlighting its compact design and solid performance. The device is equipped with an A527 processor, 2GB LPDDR3 RAM, 16GB internal storage, a 4-inch screen with a resolution of 960x720, and a 5000mAh battery. Its design is minimalistic, featuring HDMI video output, a power button, and functional keys on top. The shoulder buttons utilize micro-switches, and the joystick supports pressure-sensitive Hall sensor technology.

The device runs on Linux, supporting various game emulators like FC and PSP. During testing, the PSP game "God of War: Ghost of Sparta" achieved stable frame rates between 25-30 FPS, showcasing decent performance and smooth gameplay.
