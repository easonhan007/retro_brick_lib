The 35XXH is the horizontal version of the 35XX Plus, officially released today with three color options. The package includes the console, charging cable, screen protector, manual, and a first-release bonus carrying case. The console features two clickable joysticks, enhancing control and compatibility with PSP and some PS1 games. It sports a 3.5-inch IPS full-lamination screen with 640x480 resolution, 4:3 aspect ratio, and is powered by an H700 processor.

The buttons include silicone-based D-pad and ABXY keys, micro-switch shoulder buttons, and Switch-grade joysticks. Top ports include a 3.5mm headphone jack, Type-C charging port, OTG expansion port, and HDMI output. The device has dual speakers, offering better sound quality than the single-speaker models. On the back, it houses a 3300mAh battery, Bluetooth and WiFi modules for multiplayer, vibration motor, and anti-slip pads.

The system is identical to the 35XX Plus, supporting various emulators and game save features. Performance tests show smooth gameplay for arcade, PS1, and MD games, with accurate controls and vibrant screen visuals. Some games support vibration, enhancing immersion.

Overall, the 35XXH delivers significant upgrades in performance, audio, and controls, making it an excellent choice for fans of horizontal handheld consoles. With its strong game compatibility and user-friendly design, the 35XXH offers great value for gamers.

Enjoy your gaming experience and have a wonderful day!

## Real Experience

I have this machine. It's the purple translucent version. The system that came with it from the factory was really bad, so I replaced it with muos as soon as I got it.

The buttons of the machine are quite stiff, and the grip feeling is just so-so. Especially for the purple translucent version, it's a bit slippery.

It runs NDS games very smoothly. But when it comes to playing PSP games, the screen is too small. For other types of games, the compatibility is quite good.
