This video explains how to optimize the screen ratio and mask presets of the RGB20SX handheld console, along with detailed instructions on system flashing. Two methods are introduced: flashing the system or manually adding preset and mask files. Flashing is recommended to avoid system errors.

Steps for system flashing:  
1. Power off the console, remove the system card (marked as TFOS), and connect it to a PC.  
2. Open the shared system files (created by “God's Right Hand”), run the formatting tool, and load the downloaded .gz image file.  
3. Once flashing is complete, reinsert the system card, power on the console, and select Simplified Chinese as the language.  
4. Set the theme to CODY to match the original factory style.

After flashing, the video demonstrates optimized screen ratios and masks for various platforms such as GB, GBA, GBC, and more. The RGB20SX also supports Bluetooth functionality, with the recommended IKF SOLO Bluetooth headphones offering features such as volume control, ENC noise reduction, and up to 130 hours of battery life.

In conclusion, the presenter encourages users to optimize their RGB20SX handheld and invites viewers to support the content by liking, following, and sharing.
