The E5 Ultra is a soon-to-be-released Android handheld console priced at 399 RMB for the first 500 units, offering high value for money. It features a 5-inch 720P LCD screen powered by the T620 chip, with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, running on Android 14. While the screen design is somewhat limited, the overall performance is reasonable for its price. Button feedback is improved with tactile enhancements, including dome switches and support pillars. The joystick supports pressing functionality and comes with lighting effects, providing a comfortable user experience.

The E5 Ultra supports emulators and streaming, preloaded with PS2, PSP emulators and more, alongside a newly added online multiplayer feature for connecting with other players. Testing revealed smooth PSP emulator performance, achieving 60 frames per second in games like "Tekken 6" under double resolution settings. However, PS2 emulator performance is less optimal, requiring downscaled settings. Android games like "Genshin Impact" run seamlessly, with mapping software simplifying controls.

Design-wise, the device includes an active cooling system featuring a small fan and heat dissipation components, alongside a 5000mAh battery for solid battery life. Speakers are located at the top, providing decent audio quality but slightly lower volume. Streaming latency is moderate, making it suitable for text-based games rather than fast-paced action titles. A teardown revealed robust internal build quality with an integrated motherboard connected via interfaces. Overall, the E5 Ultra is a feature-rich and affordable handheld console.
