The DC35V is a newly released handheld console featuring a 3.5-inch 480P IPS screen with excellent display quality and full viewing angles. The device comes in a retro-style color scheme, equipped with a 4000mAh battery, supports WiFi connectivity, and vibration functionality. It includes a detailed Chinese manual, a storage pouch, and thoughtfully designed accessories. Its buttons—ABXY and the D-pad—use conductive rubber for a balanced tactile feel, while the joysticks support pressing and feature ambient lighting, with interchangeable long joysticks for enhanced operation. The slanted back design optimizes grip comfort, with speakers and a lanyard slot also included.

The standout feature of DC35V is its built-in Chinese NDS emulator in the factory system, complete with cheat codes and overclocking support, ensuring smooth gameplay, particularly for classic 4:3 ratio games. Additionally, performance for PSP and N64 games is relatively stable, with simpler titles running at around 90 frames. While more complex games may experience occasional stuttering, the overall gaming experience is decent. Furthermore, the console supports ported games, such as the latest DLC of Ninja Turtles, offering smooth performance and vibration feedback.

The console also supports third-party apps and modding features like pudding enhancements, offering strong expandability. Overall, the DC35V stands out with its portable design, versatile functionality, and practicality, making it a cost-effective choice for retro gaming fans and casual gamers.
