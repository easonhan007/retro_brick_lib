This video reviews three newly released handheld consoles this month: DC40V, XF40V, and DC35V. All three devices feature a 3326 chip, 1GB RAM, 4GB EMMC storage, and a resolution of 720x720. They support WiFi, vibration, and have replaceable batteries with a 4-day lifespan. It's recommended to use 5V1A charging to avoid potential issues from fast charging.

The primary difference between DC40V and XF40V lies in their exterior and button design. DC40V has a circular D-pad, while XF40V uses a cross-shaped D-pad. Both have slanted rear buttons designed for ergonomic use. The devices come in multiple colors, with the "electric blue" being a new addition. All models feature full-view IPS screens, with DC40V's 4.0-inch display offering superior clarity compared to DC35V's 3.5-inch screen.

System-wise, the consoles ship with version 1.4.7 pre-installed and support various emulators, including NDS, PS1, and PSP. NDS games run smoothly but require turning off HD 3D and enabling overclocking. PS1 games like "Tekken 3" achieve full-frame performance, while PSP games are recommended to be set to 1x resolution for smoother gameplay. The consoles also support third-party systems (e.g., ArkOS, UOS) with high compatibility, allowing about 80% of ported games to run smoothly.

In summary, the three devices mainly differ in design and button layout, while performance remains consistent across models. They are well-suited for retro gaming enthusiasts, with users able to select based on aesthetics and color preferences.
