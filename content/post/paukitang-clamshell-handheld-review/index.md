Paukitang has quietly released its new flip handheld console V90S at an affordable price of under 200 RMB. The console features a simplified design without dual joysticks, replaced by a glossy surface. The buttons use conductive rubber, providing a decent tactile experience, especially the D-pad, which responds well with minimal key overlap. It sports a 3.5-inch IPS screen with a resolution of 640×480, offering decent visuals and viewing angles but lacks a magnetic flip closure.

The V90S is powered by an A133P processor and equipped with 1GB of RAM. However, it doesn't include Bluetooth or WiFi and supports only single-speaker audio output. Running on an open-source Linux system, it comes pre-installed with emulators for retro games like FC and GBA. Shortcut key functions remain consistent with earlier models, allowing quick game state and display adjustments. Performance-wise, the console handles most retro games smoothly, and enabling filters significantly improves display quality.

Compared to similar products, the V90S maintains a compact and portable design but removes costly features like magnetic flip closures and dual joysticks to cut costs. Internal teardown reveals solid build quality, with plastic insulation protecting core components effectively. Overall, the V90S is a budget-friendly handheld console targeting entry-level users, ideal for nostalgic gamers or those on a tight budget.
