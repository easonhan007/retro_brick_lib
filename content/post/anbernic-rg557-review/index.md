This video presents an in-depth review of Anbernic's new handheld console, the RG557, covering its design, specifications, and gaming performance. The RG557 retains the design style of its predecessor, the RG556, featuring a 5.48-inch AMOLED screen, ergonomic grip, and strategically placed speakers that avoid blockage. Buttons use conductive materials, and the joystick includes RGB lighting, though its size is relatively small.

The RG557 is powered by the Dimensity 8300 processor, offering performance slightly better than Snapdragon 8+, and runs on Android 14. It supports retro game emulators and new emulators like the VU emulator. Its 5500mAh battery allows up to 8 hours of usage, with upgraded 27W charging. Size and weight comparisons with devices like the Switch Lite and Ayn Odin 2 highlight the RG557's portability.

During testing, the RG557 demonstrated stable performance across various classic games, including platforms like PS2, PSP, Wii, NGC, and 3DS, with excellent frame rates. The emulators support high-resolution settings, achieving up to 4K quality without lag. Additionally, RG557 performed well with Android games, featuring button mapping for enhanced gameplay.

The teardown reveals a well-structured internal design, with a neatly arranged motherboard and battery. The speakers use metal contact points, and the back panel includes a dustproof mesh. Overall, the RG557 excels in performance, compatibility, and ergonomics, despite the small joystick size. Pricing remains undisclosed, but the device shows great potential.
