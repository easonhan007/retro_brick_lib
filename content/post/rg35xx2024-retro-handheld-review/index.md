The video features an unboxing and review of the RG35XX handheld console, priced at 256 yuan. The reviewer showcases its translucent purple design and included collectible cards, while highlighting its hardware specifications, such as the 2600mAh battery capacity and H700 chipset. A custom modified system was installed, along with a 256GB memory card containing a pre-loaded game pack. Tests included games from platforms like DC, PSP, and GBA, with the system running smoothly, especially for higher-performance games. For instance, “God of War” achieved frame rates between 20 and 30 FPS, though with occasional instability.

The reviewer praised the console for its excellent cost-effectiveness, noting significant improvements in playability after adopting the H700 chipset. However, they pointed out limitations of the Garlic OS, citing its inadequate performance despite its reputation. The video also discussed enhanced display quality in modern handheld consoles, emphasizing 480P resolution as a baseline for satisfactory visual experience, while 240P is now considered outdated. Overall, the RG35XX is deemed ideal for retro emulator enthusiasts, particularly fans of GBA games. Through detailed tests and explanations, the video offers viewers valuable insights for purchasing decisions.
