This video reviews the R36S Plus handheld gaming console. The device features a 4-inch 720x720 full-view IPS screen, powered by the 3326 CPU and G31 GPU, with 1GB DDR3L RAM. It supports up to 256GB storage expansion and comes with a 3000mAh battery that offers approximately 8 hours of gameplay. The design appears slightly elongated, with conductive rubber buttons including a D-pad, ABXY keys, dual joysticks (pressable), shoulder buttons, and volume controls. While button feedback is decent, the clicking sound is slightly loud. The console includes pre-applied protective films, though the non-transparent matte finish of the casing is seen as a missed opportunity.

The video evaluates its gaming performance across various emulators such as N64, GBA, and TS1. N64 emulation struggles with low frame rates (~10 FPS), while GBA games run relatively well with occasional frame drops. Ported games like Tekken 3 perform at full frame rates, though the masking feature requires manual adjustment. Support for PPSSPP emulator is noted positively, especially with its Chinese language interface. Overall, the console’s gaming experience is decent, but the system requires further optimization. The hardware setup is solid, button response is good, and there are no evident issues like key conflicts.

In conclusion, the R36S Plus is a reasonably priced handheld console (188 RMB), offering satisfactory hardware and gaming performance. However, system refinement and design improvements are necessary to enhance its overall appeal for budget-conscious gamers.
