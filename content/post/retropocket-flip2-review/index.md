This video provides a detailed review of the engineering prototype of RetroPocket's latest clamshell handheld, the Flip2. The Flip2 comes in two configurations featuring Snapdragon 865 and Dimensity D1100 processors, paired with 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, a 5000mAh battery, and 27W fast charging. It sports a 5.5-inch 1080P OLED screen with a peak brightness of 500 nits, narrow bezels, excellent display quality, and global DC dimming support.

In terms of design, the Flip2 is compact and portable, with a well-arranged button layout. It features recessed, detachable joysticks, soft-feeling D-pad and ABXY buttons utilizing tactile dome switches. The top hosts linear triggers with anti-slip textures, while the bottom includes a TF card slot, a multifunctional Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Its back has a fan with a metal dust filter and a matte finish that resists fingerprints effectively.

The device runs Android 13 with pre-installed Retroid Launcher for game management. In real-world tests, the Flip2 smoothly ran games like "Genshin Impact" and performed stably on PS2 and PSP emulators, achieving 50-60 FPS with clear visuals. Audio quality is commendable, and the D-pad offers precise input for gaming.

Upon disassembly, the internal build quality is tight, featuring a 5000mAh battery and standard fan design, sufficient for everyday use. Overall, the Flip2 offers a balanced experience in performance, portability, and gaming, making it a promising handheld device.
