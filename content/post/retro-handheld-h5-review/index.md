The H5 handheld console is a large-sized device with a 5-inch IPS full-lamination screen, approximately the size of an 8-inch tablet. Its design is minimalistic, featuring ambient lighting, a data cable, and basic function buttons. The buttons are made of soft conductive rubber, offering a comfortable tactile experience. The console includes dual analog sticks (without press support), a DC port, an OTG port, a headphone jack, volume buttons, and a TF card slot on its sides and top.

It runs on a new closed-source system with multilingual support (including Chinese) and offers options to search for games, adjust button lights, screensavers, and themes. Preloaded with various emulators, the H5 supports platforms like PS1, Arcade, FC, and SFC games seamlessly, with PS1 games running especially smoothly. The screen delivers clear visuals, though the brightness is slightly low, and the borders are somewhat wide. The device is lightweight and comes with dual grips, making it suitable for extended gaming sessions.

Key advantages include its large screen, excellent button feedback, smooth gaming performance, and user-friendly interface. However, the lack of analog stick press support, wide screen bezels, and limited functionalities are its primary drawbacks. Overall, the H5 is a simple and accessible handheld console suitable for children or casual gamers who prefer straightforward gaming experiences.
