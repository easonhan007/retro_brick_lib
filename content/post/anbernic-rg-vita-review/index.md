This is a detailed unboxing and review of the new handheld device RG Vita by Anbernic. 

RG Vita comes in two models: the Youth version and Pro version. The Youth version offers multiple color options and resembles the PSV in design, albeit slightly larger. It features symmetrical joysticks, conductive rubber buttons, and RGB lighting. With a weight of 277g, it aligns closely with the PSV. The 5.46-inch 720P screen is centrally displayed, and the device includes a 5000mAh battery with up to 2TB memory expansion support.

In terms of performance, RG Vita is equipped with a [T618 processor](https://www.notebookcheck.net/UNISOC-Tiger-T618-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.512251.0.html). It runs classic games like PSV and PS2 smoothly but struggles with PS3 games due to performance limitations, causing fluctuating frame rates. The device supports PC streaming and cloud gaming, featuring button mapping functionality for optimizing non-controller-supported games. The audio quality is decent, without noticeable noise.

The video summarizes the pros and cons of RG Vita: it mirrors the PSV design, has a centered screen, and offers good button responsiveness. However, the button material is not crystal, slightly impacting the overall texture. The T618 processor handles mid-to-low performance games well but struggles with high-demand games. The Pro version is expected to deliver better performance, with pricing and specifications yet to be announced. Overall, RG Vita is a visually appealing and functional handheld, with the black version highly recommended.
