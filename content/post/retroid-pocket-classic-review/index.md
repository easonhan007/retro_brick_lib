The Retroid Pocket Classic is a newly released handheld console by the official channels, featuring seven color options and varying configurations, with prices differing accordingly. It is equipped with the Snapdragon G1 G2 processor, offering performance comparable to Snapdragon 695. Memory options include 4GB+64GB and 6GB+128GB. The device sports a 3.92-inch OLED screen with a resolution of 1240x1080 and a PPI exceeding 400, providing fine display quality. Running on Android, it includes a 5000mAh battery supporting 27W fast charging. The front lacks a joystick, suited for screen joystick or Bluetooth controller operation. Buttons feature a classic six-key design; the D-pad feels good but lacks a circular design. The top hosts a Type-C charging port and headphone jack, with micro switches and anti-slip design on the back. Video output is not supported. The screen uses global DC dimming, and the single speaker delivers decent audio performance. Game testing shows good compatibility with titles like Street Fighter 3 and Sega games, with filters enhancing visual experience. The internal structure is compact with unique heat sink and fan design. Overall, it is slightly smaller than Retroid Pocket 40XX, with satisfactory review results.
