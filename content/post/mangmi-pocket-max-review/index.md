Equipped with a [Snapdragon 865 processor](https://nanoreview.net/en/soc/qualcomm-snapdragon-865), 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, and priced at 1388 RMB, its key highlights include a 7-inch 144Hz screen and an 8000mAh battery.

In terms of performance, the Pocket Max supports various gaming modes, including PS2 and PC emulation. It handles PS2 games stably in Turbo Mode, while PC emulation struggles to maintain 20-30fps, indicating limited performance for more demanding scenarios. In streaming mode, latency is kept under 8ms, offering a decent experience.

On the hardware side, the console features interchangeable magnetic D-pads, supporting conductive rubber and mechanical microswitch options. Button layout follows an Xbox-style design. At 442g, it is heavier and larger than its predecessor, with added rear buttons that are firm to prevent accidental presses. The speakers are positioned on the lower sides, potentially obstructed by hands during gameplay. The joysticks are large and support multi-angle pressing, while the vibration motor is standard-grade, lacking HD haptics.

The teardown reveals an 8000mAh battery, active cooling with a fan and heat sink, and relatively large speakers despite small sound openings. Running Android 13, the system includes a game launcher and allows adjustments for refresh rate, fan speed, button mapping, and other customizable settings.

Overall, the Pocket Max strikes a balance between portability, performance, and expandability. While it struggles with demanding PC emulation, it offers strong value for retro gaming or casual gamers.
