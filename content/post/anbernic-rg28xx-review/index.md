The newly released Anbernic RG28XX handheld console demonstrates excellent performance in this review. Priced around 200 RMB and bundled with a small protective bag, it offers great value for money. The device features a vertical design with a 2.8-inch screen, providing clear visuals due to its high resolution. Powered by the Allwinner H700 processor, the same as the 35XXH, the RG28XX supports a wide range of retro gaming platforms, from FC to PSP. Additionally, it includes new features such as music playback, video playback, e-book reading, and file management, enhancing its versatility.

Weighing only 125.5 grams, the RG28XX is highly portable. It has a 3100mAh battery that provides up to 8 hours of battery life. The device is equipped with OTG support, HDMI output, and TF card expansion (up to 512GB). However, it does not support Bluetooth or WiFi connectivity. In tests, gameplay was smooth, the screen displayed vibrant colors, and while the single speaker's volume was slightly low, the audio quality was decent. The vibration feedback feature added an engaging touch to certain games.

In conclusion, the RG28XX is an entry-level retro gaming console that meets the needs of nostalgic gaming enthusiasts. Its performance is sufficient for classic games, and it comes in various colors, with purple being a popular choice. Given its price and functionality, this handheld console is highly recommended for retro game fans.
