The Dingoo A320, released in 2008, is an innovative open-source handheld console, often referred to as an "MP4" or "MP5" device. Its design borrows from the PSP's XMB interface, featuring intuitive navigation and a variety of functions. The A320 sports a 2.8-inch 320x240 resolution screen, with an acrylic overlay resembling a "bezel-less design," despite lacking full lamination.

In terms of hardware, the A320 is equipped with a D-pad, ABXY buttons, and L/R shoulder buttons, offering a soft tactile feel. The right side includes a lock switch and a 3.5mm headphone jack, while the bottom houses dual speakers, a dust-proof mesh, and a card slot with limited compatibility. It also supports AV output for connecting to TVs, allowing users to adjust the screen ratio (4:3 or 16:9).

On the functional side, the A320 features multiple entertainment modes, such as 3D games, classic games, music, video, e-books, and FM radio. Gaming-wise, the A320 supports some GBA and classic arcade games, with smooth loading speeds and a vibrant display. The music and radio functions allow background playback, and its dual speakers provide decent sound quality.

Additionally, the A320 offers extensive system settings, including theme customization, screen brightness adjustment, and language options. However, due to the technological limitations of 2008, the device lacks internet connectivity and has a limited library of games, though users can expand content via external cards. Overall, the A320 stands out for its functionality and portability, marking a significant milestone in open-source handheld development.
