Langzi Handheld Channel presents an in-depth review of the G90 console. Featuring a 7-inch full-view IPS screen, the display quality and brightness are excellent, making it ideal for users with nearsightedness or astigmatism. Key specs include a 32-bit K3028 processor, 12MB RAM, Mali-400MP2 GPU, and Linux 5.1 kernel, with a 4000mAh battery providing solid endurance. The device weighs 357g, giving it a sturdy feel.

In terms of gaming performance, the G90 handles GBA, MD, PS1, and arcade games smoothly, with outstanding audio quality. Surprisingly, it performs well with PSP and N64 games, showing minimal lag even in demanding scenarios. However, DC games like "Crazy Taxi" face performance limitations, leading to occasional stutters. The dual analog sticks support clickable functions, and the buttons feel decent, though the D-pad has a split design.

Additional features include HDMI output, OTG support, and a TF card slot, with the system running on version E4.7. It comes preloaded with a wide range of classic retro games, making it an excellent choice for home entertainment, especially for kids. Overall, the G90 stands out for its impressive screen, audio quality, and battery life, appealing to retro gaming enthusiasts and family users alike.
