This new handheld console sets a high standard for value, making it an excellent choice for retro gaming enthusiasts. Key hardware features include a 7-inch large IPS screen, a 4000mAh battery, and support for up to 256GB of expandable storage, offering clear visuals and extended battery life. It comes preloaded with over 30,000 classic games, supporting platforms like PSP, arcade, and GBA, and includes features such as one-click save, two-player mode, and TV casting. The controls are comfortable with soft conductive rubber buttons, and the top of the device offers various ports, including a headphone jack, HDMI output, and more. It runs on a straightforward EE system.

In terms of gaming performance, the console supports PSP games at a high level, running smoothly as demonstrated in titles like "God of War" and racing games, without noticeable lag or audio issues. GBA and PS1 games also run seamlessly, and while the screen cannot achieve pixel-perfect scaling, the large display enhances the retro gaming experience.

Overall, this handheld console delivers near-professional gaming performance at a budget-friendly price. Its strengths lie in its large screen, long battery life, multi-platform compatibility, extensive game library, and convenient features, making it an excellent choice for both nostalgic players and newcomers to retro gaming. The only downside is its average portability, but it remains a highly cost-effective handheld console.
