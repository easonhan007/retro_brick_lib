This video reviews the mini X55 handheld console, which balances practicality and portability. The device features a 3.5-inch IPS full-fit screen with a fresh color scheme. It uses Hall joysticks with a recessed design, soft buttons, and multiple ports such as HDMI video output, two TF card slots, a Type-C charging port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. However, it lacks Bluetooth and WiFi, relying on 2.4G OTG for external controller connections.

The system runs a custom Linux OS that supports various emulators. Users can adjust image ratios, frame rate displays, and filter effects, and it offers cheat functionalities like unlimited health or magic. However, the system is not fully polished, with a simplistic interface and limited preset features.

In terms of gaming performance, the console runs "God of War" with frame rates between 15-20 FPS, while games like "Monster Hunter" achieve up to 30 FPS in smaller scenes. Classic 2D games, such as "Contra" or "Castlevania," run more smoothly, though the screen ratio may cause black bars. The console also supports joystick touch emulation, making it suitable for NDS games, and overall gameplay is user-friendly.

In conclusion, the mini X55 is a compact and versatile device that appeals to retro gaming enthusiasts. However, its RK366 processor limits performance, and the absence of Bluetooth and WiFi is a notable drawback.
