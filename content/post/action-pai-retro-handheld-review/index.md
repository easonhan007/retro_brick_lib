The video presents a newly released handheld console from the brand "Action Party." This console features a rare 4-inch 4:3 IPS display with a resolution of 960x702 for its price range. It is equipped with an A527 chip, a maximum frequency of 2.0GHz, and a G57MC1 GPU, along with 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage. It supports 2.4G WiFi and 4.2 Bluetooth connections, has a 5000mAh battery, and weighs 220 grams. The video provides a detailed review of the console's design and buttons, noting their anti-ghosting design and good tactile feedback, though some buttons feel stiff. The device supports HDMI output for TV connectivity, features a slightly lower-positioned joystick, and displays excellent screen performance, especially for retro games. It supports standby power-saving mode and showcases smooth gameplay during large-screen gaming tests with vibration feedback. Although it cannot reach 60 frames per second, it can maintain a stable 30 frames per second while running "God of War." The video concludes by highlighting the console's strengths, such as good D-pad feel, excellent screen performance, and competitive pricing among similar products, though its system requires further optimization. The device's heat generation is within an acceptable range, with hopes for future system improvements to enhance performance.
