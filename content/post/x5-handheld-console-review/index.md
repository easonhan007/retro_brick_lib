This video showcases the unboxing and review of the new X5 handheld console. The packaging is entirely in English, indicating it’s likely aimed at international markets. While the box states the processor is A7, the actual processor might differ. Upon booting up, the device runs a closed-source system with features like search, favorites, and history. The screen is estimated to have a resolution of 480P and uses a full-lamination design. The console includes a TF card slot and dual joysticks. Games such as *Metal Slug 5* and *Sengoku Ace 2* were tested, showing smooth performance, although some features like special moves didn’t work properly. While PS1 games ran decently, GBA games like *Dragon Ball Adventure* suffered from frame drops and slowdowns.

The review highlights the console’s affordable price of only 135 RMB, making it very cost-effective. However, its performance and design are limited. The processor might be VT569B, which is weaker than the 3326 chip. The sound quality is constrained by a single speaker, which remains loud even at the lowest volume setting. The dual joystick design seems unnecessary since it cannot handle complex games requiring joysticks. Additionally, the system lacks third-party software support, and in-game save functionality is restricted. In summary, the X5 handheld console is suitable for budget-conscious users with modest performance needs, with its strengths lying in its price and screen quality.
