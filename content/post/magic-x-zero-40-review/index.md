This video reviews the Magic X Zero 40, a handheld device designed primarily for NDS emulation. The device features a 400x800 2:1 IPS full-laminated screen, offering better display quality than the NDS but with an unattractive design. Its controls include a D-pad, a recessed joystick, and Android 10 OS. The top houses L1/L2, R1/R2 buttons, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a charging port, but no video output. The back has decorative ventilation holes, with actual cooling relying on basic thermal paste and a heat sink.

For NDS emulation, the Zero 40 supports capacitive styluses for its touchscreen, as finger input often blocks the small screen. Gaming performance is adequate, though the display appears dim, and the filter optimization is limited. Point-to-point display is not fully achieved. The device supports other emulators (GBA, SFC, NES, etc.), but the long screen ratio hinders horizontal games. While it supports Android apps, performance is inconsistent, making it better suited as a gaming device.

The teardown reveals a simple internal design, with a mandatory system card (called a "talent card") required for booting. Priced at around 450 RMB, it costs nearly as much as two second-hand NDS consoles but fails to fully replicate the NDS experience. In conclusion, the Zero 40 is more of an experimental handheld device, appealing to curious gamers but not an ideal NDS replacement.
