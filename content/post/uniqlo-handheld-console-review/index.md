The video showcases the unboxing and initial review of the UNIQLO licensed handheld console. The console comes in a large box with model number L235, equipped with a 3.8V 3000mAh battery and supports a 5V/1A power input. Inside the box are a character card from "The Knights of Valour," a licensed game experience card, the console itself, a data cable, and a manual. The button layout includes ABXY buttons, a D-pad, and dual joysticks without press-down support. The exit, volume, and power buttons use micro-switch technology, providing a solid feel, and the overall craftsmanship is precise.

The console exterior is light orange, with a 3.5mm headphone jack, a TF card slot, and a Type-C charging port at the bottom. Upon startup, the screen shows the UNIQLO logo, featuring 16 built-in classic IGS games like "The Knights of Valour," "Magic Stars," and "Journey to the West." The video demonstrates the smooth gameplay, with a 3.5-inch IPS full-lamination screen offering adjustable brightness levels, providing good visual performance. The interface is straightforward, with options to save, load, and exit games. While the game selection is limited, for fans of IGS games, particularly "The Knights of Valour," this console holds significant collectible value.
