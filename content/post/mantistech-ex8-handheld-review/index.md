Mantistech has introduced a new handheld console, the EX8, priced at approximately ¥669. It features a 4.88-inch 3:2 glass screen with a 1080P resolution and is powered by the [MediaTek G99](https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/mediatek-helio-g99) processor. The design is minimalistic and boxy, featuring a metallic finish but lacks ergonomic grips. The shoulder buttons use micro-switches with a stiff feel, while the D-pad, made of conductive rubber, has occasional input issues. The joysticks support press functionality and come with customizable RGB lighting.

The screen performance is average, with slightly dull colors and a bluish tint, falling short when compared to similar devices. In terms of gaming, the EX8 handles GBA emulation well but struggles with PS2 games like *God of War 2*, requiring frame rate locking at 30 FPS for smoother performance. The fan operates quietly but its cooling efficiency may be limited due to design flaws. The Android system supports streaming, but the decoding latency (~20ms) makes it less suitable for latency-sensitive games.

From a design perspective, the screws are hidden beneath the screen, requiring destructive disassembly for internal access. Positioned as an entry-level device, the EX8 offers affordability and support for various emulators but is held back by mediocre screen quality and subpar button feedback. It’s unclear if future OTA updates could address the input and screen issues.
