Mami AirX is a highly cost-effective handheld console, and this video provides a detailed evaluation of its gaming performance, streaming capabilities, and internal craftsmanship. Key findings are as follows:

1. **Button and Gaming Performance**: Button tests showed no input conflicts, and the response was highly sensitive. In the Android game "Genshin Impact," the console supported direct controller operation with smooth performance at low graphics settings. In "Delta Force," button mapping and gyroscope-assisted aiming enhanced the overall gameplay experience.

2. **Emulator Game Performance**: For PS2 games like "God of War," the default settings achieved 30 FPS. Adjusting to double PMP settings stabilized the frame rate at 60 FPS. High-definition games like "Dynasty Warriors" and "Monster Hunter 3HD" ran smoothly at 1080P resolution with steady frame rates.

3. **Streaming Capabilities**: PC game streaming maintained a network latency of around 5ms, delivering an excellent frame rate and responsive control experience.

4. **Internal Build Quality**: The teardown revealed a well-crafted interior design, featuring a 5000mAh battery, heat sinks, and a small fan. The compact layout and high-quality components reflected superior craftsmanship.

In summary, Mami AirX stands out as a budget-friendly handheld console that excels in playing high-definition PMP games, running PS2 emulator titles, and streaming PC games. With exceptional internal build quality, it is an ideal choice for gamers seeking performance without overspending.
