The new Anbernic handheld, "Adidas Lite," has officially launched today. Powered by the T820 processor, it scores nearly 500,000 in benchmarks, showcasing strong performance. The device features a 1280×900 resolution screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, offering sharp visuals without screen flickering. It supports gamepad functionality, demonstrated with games like "Genshin Impact," and provides button mapping for games lacking native controller support. An AI translation feature enables real-time in-game content translation via a floating window, which can be toggled off. Additionally, the device offers categorized game downloads for easy access to preferred titles.

The video highlights gameplay tests on platforms like PS1, PS2, NDS, and 3DS. PS1 games achieve perfect full-screen display, PS2 games run smoothly at double resolution, and 3DS games show improved visuals with adjusted aspect ratios. Input responsiveness for joysticks and d-pad is commendable, with no key mapping errors observed. Overall, the gaming performance is fluid, with consistent frame rates.

The teardown reveals the device’s cooling design, featuring a single heat pipe, turbo fan, and thermal paste. Heat concentration is near the right-hand grip area, offering a mildly warm touch during operation. While the device is bulkier compared to the PSP GO, its slide-out mechanism is satisfying, and the screen-to-body ratio is reasonable. The video concludes by inviting viewers to share their opinions about the product in the comments section.
