This video provides a detailed review of the R36VX handheld console, comparing it to the popular R36S model. The R36VX is marketed as a highly cost-effective device, priced under 100 RMB. Key specifications include the 14.7 system, 3326 chipset, 1GB RAM, 3.5-inch 480P IPS screen, 3000mAh battery, and 5V2A charging support. The design resembles the R36S but features a matte finish for increased durability.

The button layout includes a slightly stiff D-pad that minimizes mispresses, standard ABXY buttons, a joystick, and functional keys with decent tactile feedback. Ports include a DC port, OTG, headphone jack, and single TF card slot. Notably, the device lacks vibration and WiFi functionality.

In gaming tests, the R36VX performs smoothly on PS1 and NDS titles, but struggles with PSP games like *Tekken 6*, running at just 20FPS on default settings. N64 games deliver average frame rates due to core limitations. The screen, while average in brightness, offers satisfactory IPS display quality.

Overall, the R36VX delivers standard 3326-level performance, comparable to the R36S but at a more affordable price point. It is an ideal choice for budget-conscious gamers seeking value for money.
