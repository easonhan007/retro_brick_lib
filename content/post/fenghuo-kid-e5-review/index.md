The video introduces the E5 handheld console by Mante Technology, known as "Fenghuo Kid E5". The device features a square design with a foam lining and an A2C charging cable. The E5 utilizes a single joystick design with a joystick light and a removable transparent cover for a softer touch. It has AXBY silicon pads and micro-motion shoulder buttons, dual speakers on the back, and a support rod. It includes two C ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, SDMI video output, and a game card slot. The screen is a 16:9, 720P IPS full-fit display, with a system similar to a TV box supporting games from arcade to PS1.

The processor, an A8, can smoothly run PS1 and GBA games, but screen ratio issues are significant. Despite lacking acceleration and screen ratio adjustment features, the d-pad is responsive, making it suitable for arcade and fighting games. The video tested various games like "King of Fighters 97", "Street Fighter 3", and "Three Kingdoms 2", showing overall smooth performance though with ratio concerns. The conclusion suggests system optimization and hopes to add Linux for better playability. Currently, E5 is in the engineering stage, with anticipation for its official release.
