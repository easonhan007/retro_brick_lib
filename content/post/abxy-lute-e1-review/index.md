Today, we reviewed the ABXY open-source handheld device named LUTE E1. This device features a dual-system design, running on Linux and Android. The Linux system uses the familiar ES interface, with a screen size of 3.5 inches and a resolution of 640x480. Although it lacks touch functionality, it supports various emulators. The Android system is challenging to operate due to the absence of touch features, relying solely on button navigation, which affects the installation and usage of third-party applications.

On the hardware side, the LUTE E1 is equipped with the [3566 chipset](https://www.rock-chips.com/a/cn/product/RK35xilie/2021/0113/1273.html) and a 3500mAh battery, supporting WiFi and Bluetooth. The handheld's design includes micro-switch joysticks that support press-down functionality and conductive rubber D-pads, though there might be key overlap issues in certain games. The exterior design is simple, offering lighting effects and expansion features such as a TF card slot and HDMI output.

The device supports multiple emulators but struggles with high-performance games like PSP, showing frame drops. Games with a 4:3 aspect ratio perform better, but users need to adjust the screen ratio for optimal results. Overall, the LUTE E1's Linux system has been somewhat optimized, while the Android system lacks functionality, impacting the overall user experience.
