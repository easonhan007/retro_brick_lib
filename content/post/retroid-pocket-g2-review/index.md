The Retroid Pocket G2, also known as RP5.5, is an upgraded version of RP5, priced at ¥1399. It features the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8G2 processor, which is comparable in performance to Snapdragon 8G2 but with slightly weaker GPU power. The design is identical to the RP5, including the screen, button layout, and ports, but adds two new color options: turquoise and yellow. The weight remains nearly the same (around 269g). Performance-wise, RP5.5 delivers a 50% improvement over RP5, with significant enhancements in both CPU and GPU performance, doubling the GPU capability.

The RP5.5 is equipped with a 5.5-inch full DC dimming screen and runs on the upgraded Android 15 system. It supports high resolutions and smooth gaming experiences. Emulator tests for PSV and PSP games reveal stable frame rates, with PSP games reaching 10x resolution and maintaining 60 FPS. Additionally, its USB-C port supports full-feature video output, allowing connection to 4K displays for enhanced visuals.

Thermal performance is impressive, with body temperatures around 30°C and fan noise at approximately 56 decibels, ensuring quiet operation. Internal teardown shows that the RP5.5 shares nearly identical design with RP5, with differences primarily in the motherboard and processor. Overall, the RP5.5 is a cost-effective handheld console offering powerful performance for emulator enthusiasts.

This video provides a comprehensive review of the RP5.5's design, performance, and real-world usage, highlighting its differences from the RP5 to help users make informed decisions between the two models.
